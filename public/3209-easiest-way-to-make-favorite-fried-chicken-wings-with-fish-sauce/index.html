<h5 id="instructions-to-make-fried-chicken-wings-with-fish-sauce">Instructions to make Fried Chicken Wings with Fish Sauce:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Wash chicken wings well, I usually some salt to gently rub on the skin and rinse them well under the tap to get rid of bad smell. Cut at elbow joints or into small pieces as desired.</li>
<li>Put chicken wings into a bowl, marinate with 1/3 teaspoon of seasoning powder, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 2 teaspoons of fish sauce. Squeeze liquid out of minced shallots and garlic into chicken wings, keep the residue. Mix well and set aside to marinate for about 15 minutes.</li>
